App for "International Hydrogen and Fuel Cell conference 2018". In the spring of 2018, there was held a conference about renewable energy and Hydrogen Fuel Cells in Trondheim, Norway. We developed a react native app to show the keynote times and locations as well as other useful information for the conference. The app is no longer in the appstores.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

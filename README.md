# project_energy
App for "International Hydrogen and Fuel Cell conference 2018". In the spring, there will be held a conference about renewable energy and Hydrogen Fuel Cells in Trondheim, Norway. We have been asked to develop an app that will display the schedule of the conference as well as notify participants when and where lectures are being held.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
